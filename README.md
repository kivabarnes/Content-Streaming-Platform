# Decentralized Content Streaming Platform

A blockchain-based streaming platform that enables direct creator-to-viewer content distribution with automated rights management, monetization, and recommendations.

## Overview

This platform leverages smart contracts to create a transparent and efficient ecosystem for content streaming. By removing traditional intermediaries, we enable direct relationships between creators and viewers while ensuring fair compensation and rights management.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Content Licensing Contract

Manages digital rights and permissions for all content on the platform:
- Content registration and ownership verification
- License terms definition and enforcement
- Access control and permission management
- Content hash verification for authenticity
- Transfer and sublicensing capabilities

### Streaming Token Contract

Implements flexible monetization models for content access:
- Pay-per-view microtransactions
- Time-based subscription models
- Token minting and burning mechanics
- Balance tracking and automatic payments
- Subscription status verification

### Revenue Sharing Contract

Handles automated distribution of earnings:
- Creator revenue allocation
- Collaborator payment splitting
- Automated payout scheduling
- Transaction fee management
- Revenue analytics and reporting

### Content Recommendation Contract

Provides personalized content discovery:
- User preference tracking
- Content metadata analysis
- Viewing history aggregation
- Collaborative filtering algorithms
- Recommendation weighting system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16.0 or higher
- Hardhat development environment
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- IPFS node (optional for content hosting)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-streaming-platform.git
cd decentralized-streaming-platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Compile smart contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

For coverage report:
```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```

## Architecture

The platform operates through four main components:

1. **Content Management Layer**
    - Content upload and storage
    - Metadata management
    - Rights verification
    - Access control

2. **Payment Layer**
    - Token economics
    - Transaction processing
    - Subscription management
    - Revenue distribution

3. **Recommendation Layer**
    - User profiling
    - Content analysis
    - Recommendation generation
    - Preference learning

4. **Frontend Layer**
    - User interface
    - Wallet integration
    - Content playback
    - Creator dashboard

## Usage

### For Content Creators

1. Connect wallet and register as a creator
2. Upload content and define licensing terms
3. Set pricing models (pay-per-view or subscription)
4. Configure revenue sharing for collaborators
5. Monitor analytics and earnings

### For Viewers

1. Connect wallet and browse content
2. Purchase tokens or subscribe
3. Access licensed content
4. Receive personalized recommendations
5. Rate and review content

## Security Considerations

- Smart contracts are audited by [Audit Partner]
- Content encryption using industry standards
- Multi-signature requirements for contract upgrades
- Rate limiting on critical operations
- Emergency pause functionality
